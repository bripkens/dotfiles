# My Dotfiles

## Installation
I do not yet enough experience with the one time setup scripts under `setup/`.
You should therefore cherry pick the things that you actually require.

The actual bash configuration can be linked in the following way:

```
git clone git@github.com:bripkens/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
bash "~/.dotfiles/link"
```

## Inspiration
My dotfiles are heavily inspired by
[Mathias Bynens'](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) and
[Ben Alman's](https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles) dotfiles
and many other great blog posts on the web. Thanks guys!
